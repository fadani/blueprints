# Pre-prio call

### Responsibilities before the pre-prio:

#### For Contributors:
Look at what you have planned in the coming week and prepare to 1) highlight if you don’t have enough to do and 2) be able to answer if you can pick up more work.

#### Project/domain owners:

Look at your project list and prepare to:
1. Ask for contributors time (i.e. starting on something).
2. Ask for status update (if needed)
3. Plan what state the project could get to by next week

### Schedule of the call

For each contributor, one-by-one:

1. Talk about how the previous week went. How did it go? Any rolling projects?
2. What will you be working on next week?
3. How much free capacity do you have for next week? (This will give project/domain owners a chance to understand what will be possible.)
4. Project/domain owners highlight the projects that they would like to start and we discuss if it’s possible.
5. Each individual to write up what they want to accomplish for each project, and how much time are they planning to spend on it in the channel. 
6. Update Monday.com

### In case of conflict

- If the conflict is on the domain level, let the domain owner decide
- If the conflict is between domains, let the exec sponsor decide
