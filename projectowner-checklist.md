## 📐 Planning:
- [ ] **Create a Slack channel**
- [ ] **Assign a tech lead**
- [ ] **Initiate kick off call**
- [ ] **Create and Fill out the (now simplified!) Project doc**
- [ ] Does it requires coordination with Marketing? Then plan accordingly
- [ ] **Set ETA.** Got a hard deadline? Then plan accordingly
- [ ] **Put it on the weekly roadmap at the pre-prio session**
- [ ] **Link the project doc in the channel description**

## 🏗 Design + Development + QA
- [ ] Research on best practices, how competitors does it, etc.	
- [ ] Do we need usability testing? If yes, plan accordingly.
- [ ] consider Scripts, Kids app, Niche, International, Web app, Global Eagle when adding this feature
- [ ] Verify if we need to communicate changes to existing users? If yes, plan it.
- [ ] Verify if we should update ASO assets. If yes, initiate it.
- [ ] Verify if we should update UI translation. If yes, initiate it.
- [ ] **Follow up with contributors regularly 🎙 ⏩**
- [ ] Tech leads organises QA
- [ ] Enable testing (feature flag) for the team & **Ask for internal feedback**
- [ ] Project owner tested the feature :)
- 

## ⚗️ AB testing
- [ ] **Verify if it requires an AB test**
- [ ] Define test hypothesis
- [ ] **Primary KPI we want to increase**
- [ ] Secondary KPI we want to increase (if there’s one)
- [ ] **State what change do we expect to have for our primary & secondary KPI?**
- [ ] Figure out when is the test expected to run?
- [ ] inform support on #ab-test-support channel of the intended ab test before launching

## ⚖️ AB test evaluation
- [ ] **Verify if the test was successful**
- [ ] **If the test wasn’t successful evaluate the options**
- [ ] **If the test wasn’t successful and we decide to not iterate summarise learnings and reasoning in the Slack channel**

## 🚀 Rollout
- [ ] Verify if we broke any of the other apps (Scripts, Kids app, Niche, International, Web app, Global Eagle)? If yes, plan to fix it.
- [ ] Verify if we need to update any of the other apps? If yes, plan accordingly.
- [ ] Inform support of the changes.
- [ ] Verify if we should update Release notes? If yes, initiate it.

- [ ] Verify if there were tradeoffs made (not implemented)for this rollout that could be part of a v2.


## 🧠 Rollout / not rollout lessons learned
- [ ] **Organise a knowledge share meeting if there are learnings from the test.**
- [ ] **If the test wasn't successful, evaluate if we could remove some of the risky assumptions, and re-run the test.**
- [ ] **Ask if we should iterate OR double down on this project (No matter what the outcome is)**
- [ ] **If there were ideas in the knowledge share make sure they are captured in the backlogs.**
- [ ] Create a ticket to clean up the AB test code
- [ ] **Arrange a retro with the executive sponsor evaluating the management aspect of the project**
- [ ] **Close the Slack channel**
- [ ] Do happy dance 🕺🏻
